# Research System v8.6.0 - Adaptive Intelligence Platform

A production-ready, principal engineer-grade research system that delivers **decision-grade** intelligence with **adaptive quality thresholds** that respond to evidence supply conditions. Built with v8.6.0's supply-aware gates, adaptive report length, and evidence repair chains.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+** (required)
- API keys in `.env` file (optional, but recommended for full features)

### Installation & Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/your-org/research_agent.git
cd research_agent
./setup_environment.sh

# 2. Add API keys to .env (optional)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# 3. Run research
./run_full_features.sh "Your research topic here"
```

### Example Usage
```bash
# Full-featured research with all enhancements
./run_full_features.sh "AI impact on global economy 2024-2025"

# Basic research (without API keys)
SEARCH_PROVIDERS="" ENABLE_FREE_APIS=true python3.11 -m research_system \
  --topic "your topic" --strict --output-dir outputs
```

## 🎯 Adaptive Quality System (v8.6.0)

### Supply-Aware Quality Gates
The system now **adapts thresholds dynamically** based on evidence availability:

#### Triangulation Thresholds
- **Normal Supply**: 35% triangulation required (strict mode)
- **Constrained Supply**: 30% triangulation (when domains < 8 or cards < 30)
- **Low Supply**: 25% triangulation (when domains < 6 or cards < 25 or error rate > 30%)
- **Absolute Minimums**: 10 triangulated cards (normal) / 8 cards (low supply)

#### Primary Source Requirements
- **Standard**: 40% of evidence from primary sources
- **Limited Supply**: 30% when primary/credible ratio < 0.5
- **Whitelisted Domains**: OECD, IMF, World Bank, central banks preserved as singletons

#### Domain Balance
- **Default Cap**: 25% max from any single domain
- **Few Domains**: 40% cap when < 6 unique domains
- **Smart Relaxation**: Prevents over-trimming quality sources

#### Last-Mile Backfill
- Triggers when within 5pp of triangulation target
- Requires > 20% time budget remaining
- Activates after 2+ regular backfill attempts

### Adaptive Report Generation

Reports automatically scale based on evidence quality:

| Tier | Word Count | Token Budget | Triggers |
|------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Brief** | 600-900 | ~1,200 | Rapid depth, low supply, confidence < 0.55 |
| **Standard** | 1,100-1,600 | ~2,200 | Normal evidence, moderate confidence |
| **Deep** | 1,800-2,800 | ~3,800 | Rich evidence, confidence ≥ 0.75, 20+ triangulated |

#### Confidence Calculation
```
confidence = 0.4*triangulation + 0.3*primary_share + 0.2*domain_diversity + 0.1*(1-error_rate)
```

#### Report Features
- **Confidence Badge**: 🟢 High | 🟡 Moderate | 🔴 Low
- **Supply Context**: Transparent reporting of evidence constraints
- **Adaptive Sections**: Token budgets adjust per tier
- **Quality Signals**: Clear explanations of any threshold adjustments

### Evidence Repair & Validation

#### Snippet Repair Chain
When evidence lacks snippets, automatic repair attempts:
1. Best quote extraction
2. Quotes list scanning  
3. Abstract fallback
4. Supporting text extraction
5. Claim text usage
6. Title as last resort

#### Validation Enhancements
- Non-fatal warnings for repairable issues
- Automatic field population for missing data
- Score boundary enforcement (0-1 range)
- Schema compliance with self-healing

- Runtime threshold adaptation
- Persistent config save/load

## 📊 Metrics & Observability

### Quality Metrics Tracked
- `union_triangulation`: Cross-source corroboration rate
- `primary_share_in_union`: Authoritative source percentage
- `unique_domains`: Source diversity count
- `provider_error_rate`: API failure rate (403/429/timeouts)
- `triangulated_cards`: Absolute corroborated count
- `credible_cards`: Cards meeting credibility threshold
- `adaptive_confidence`: Computed confidence score (0-1)

### Supply Context Detection
```python
LOW_EVIDENCE = domains < 6 OR cards < 25 OR error_rate >= 0.30
CONSTRAINED = domains < 8 OR cards < 30 OR error_rate >= 0.20
NORMAL = all thresholds met
```

### Confidence Levels
- **High** 🟢: Tri ≥ 35%, Primary ≥ 40%, normal supply
- **Moderate** 🟡: Adjusted thresholds met with constraints
- **Low** 🔴: Critical thresholds not met, interpret with caution
